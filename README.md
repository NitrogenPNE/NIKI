Introduction
NIKI (Nitrogen Intelligent Knowledge Interface) is a sophisticated AI-powered module designed to handle knowledge management, data analytics, and decision-making within the Nitrogen PNE ecosystem. NIKI seamlessly integrates with other Nitrogen PNE components like SHAWN and DALE to enhance the overall functionality and provide intelligent insights that drive system optimization, data integrity, and privacy management.

Features
AI-Driven Knowledge Management: NIKI uses AI and machine learning to manage and analyze vast amounts of data, providing real-time insights and recommendations.
Integration with Decentralized Systems: NIKI is designed to work seamlessly with other decentralized systems within the Nitrogen PNE ecosystem, ensuring smooth data flow and consistent knowledge updates.
Real-Time Decision Support: NIKI provides real-time decision-making capabilities, helping administrators and systems make informed choices based on up-to-date knowledge and analytics.
Automation and Task Management: Automates routine tasks and complex operations within the Nitrogen PNE ecosystem, freeing up resources and reducing human error.
Privacy and Security Compliance: NIKI ensures that all operations adhere to the strict privacy and security standards set by Nitrogen PNE, maintaining the integrity of user data and system operations.
Installation
To install NIKI, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/NitrogenPNE/niki.git
cd niki
Install Dependencies:
NIKI relies on various npm packages for its operations. Install these dependencies using:

bash

npm install
Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and configure the necessary environment variables as outlined in the Configuration section.

Start NIKI:
Once everything is set up, you can start NIKI using:

bash

npm start
Usage
Initializing NIKI
Before using NIKI, it must be initialized with the proper configurations and connected to the rest of the Nitrogen PNE ecosystem.

javascript

const Niki = require('./niki');
const niki = new Niki({
  ownerId: 'owner-id',
  knowledgeBasePath: './data/knowledge-base.json',
  enableLearning: true
});

niki.initialize();
Integrating with Other Systems
NIKI is designed to work closely with other systems like SHAWN and DALE. You can integrate NIKI by establishing connections with these systems during initialization:

javascript

niki.integrateWithSHAWN(shawnInstance);
niki.integrateWithDALE(daleInstance);
Running Knowledge Queries
NIKI allows you to run complex knowledge queries to retrieve data, analyze trends, or make predictions.

javascript

const queryResults = niki.runQuery({
  queryType: 'trendAnalysis',
  parameters: {
    dateRange: 'lastMonth',
    dataPoints: ['userActivity', 'transactionVolume']
  }
});

console.log('Query Results:', queryResults);
Training and Learning
NIKI supports continuous learning to improve its knowledge base and decision-making capabilities. You can feed new data to NIKI to refine its models:

javascript

const trainingData = [
  // ... new data points
];

niki.trainModel(trainingData);
Configuration
Environment Variables
NIKI requires certain environment variables to be set for proper operation. Here’s an example .env file:

makefile

NODE_ENV=production
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH=./data/knowledge-base.json
ENABLE_LEARNING=true
LOG_LEVEL=info
Advanced Settings
Knowledge Base Path: Specify the path where NIKI’s knowledge base is stored. This should be a JSON file containing structured data that NIKI uses to make decisions.
Learning Mode: Enable or disable NIKI’s learning capabilities. When enabled, NIKI will continuously learn from new data and improve its models over time.
API Reference
NIKI provides a set of APIs for developers to interact with its knowledge base, run queries, and manage integrations. Detailed API documentation is available in the docs/api.md file.

Here’s a brief overview:

initialize(): Initializes NIKI with the configured settings.
integrateWithSHAWN(shawnInstance): Connects NIKI with a SHAWN instance for shared operations.
integrateWithDALE(daleInstance): Connects NIKI with a DALE instance for shared operations.
runQuery(queryOptions): Runs a knowledge query based on specified parameters.
trainModel(trainingData): Feeds new data into NIKI for training and model improvement.
