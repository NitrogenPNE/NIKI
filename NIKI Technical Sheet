Monitoring Module: Tracks system performance, detects anomalies, and provides reports.
4. Installation
To install and set up NIKI, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/NitrogenPNE/niki.git
cd niki
Install Dependencies

NIKI requires several npm packages. Install these dependencies with:

bash

npm install
Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file and set up the required environment variables (see Configuration for details).

Start NIKI

You can start NIKI with the following command:

bash

npm start
5. Configuration
NIKI can be customized via environment variables and configuration files.

6. Environment Variables
NODE_ENV: Specifies the environment (development, production, etc.).
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH: Path to the knowledge base JSON file.
ENABLE_LEARNING: Enables or disables the learning feature (true or false).
LOG_LEVEL: Sets the logging level (info, debug, error).
Example .env file:
makefile
Copy code
NODE_ENV=production
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_PATH=./data/knowledge-base.json
ENABLE_LEARNING=true
LOG_LEVEL=info
7. Advanced Settings
NIKI's behavior can be further customized through advanced settings, such as:

Learning Rate: Adjust the learning rate for the AI models.
Performance Threshold: Set thresholds for system performance metrics.
Backup Schedule: Define how often backups of the knowledge base are created.
8. Usage
Initializing NIKI
Before using NIKI, it must be initialized:

javascript

const Niki = require('./niki');
const niki = new Niki({
  ownerId: 'your-owner-id',
  knowledgeBasePath: './data/knowledge-base.json',
  enableLearning: true
});

niki.initialize();
Running Knowledge Queries
NIKI can execute complex knowledge queries:

javascript

const results = niki.runQuery({
  queryType: 'anomalyDetection',
  parameters: {
    dateRange: 'lastMonth',
    dataPoints: ['transactionVolume', 'userActivity']
  }
});

console.log('Anomaly Detection Results:', results);
Integrating with Other Components
NIKI integrates with other components of Nitrogen PNE like SHAWN and DALE:

javascript

niki.integrateWithSHAWN(shawnInstance);
niki.integrateWithDALE(daleInstance);
Training and Learning
To continuously improve, NIKI can be trained with new data:

javascript

const trainingData = [
  // Array of training data
];

niki.trainModel(trainingData);
Monitoring and Reporting
NIKI can monitor system performance and generate reports:

javascript

niki.generateReport({
  reportType: 'performance',
  parameters: {
    startDate: '2024-01-01',
    endDate: '2024-02-01'
  }
});
9. API Reference
NIKI's API provides a comprehensive interface for interaction. Here are key methods:

initialize(): Sets up NIKI with the necessary configurations.
runQuery(queryOptions): Runs a knowledge query.
trainModel(trainingData): Trains NIKI with new data.
integrateWithSHAWN(shawnInstance): Integrates NIKI with SHAWN.
integrateWithDALE(daleInstance): Integrates NIKI with DALE.
